Jeffrey Dahmer
Jeffrey Dahmer, also known as the Milwaukee Cannibal or the Milwaukee Monster, was an American serial killer and sex offender. Born on May 21, 1960, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Dahmer committed the murder and dismemberment of 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991. His crimes involved necrophilia, cannibalism, and the permanent preservation of body parts, typically all or part of the skeletal structure.

Dahmer was known to have had a troubled childhood. He exhibited signs of abandonment issues and was often withdrawn. His fascination with death and dismemberment began at an early age, and he started by collecting dead animals and dissecting them. His behavior grew more erratic over the years, culminating in his first murder at the age of 18.

Dahmer's killing spree was marked by extreme brutality. He would often lure his victims to his apartment with promises of money or alcohol, and once there, he would drug them, kill them, and then engage in acts of necrophilia and cannibalism. He also preserved various body parts as trophies.

In 1991, Dahmer was finally caught after one of his intended victims managed to escape and alert the police. Upon searching his apartment, authorities found photographs of dismembered bodies, severed heads, and other remains, leading to his arrest. Dahmer confessed to his crimes in great detail, expressing little remorse for his actions.

Jeffrey Dahmer was convicted of 15 of the 17 murders he had committed and was sentenced to 15 consecutive life terms in prison. On November 28, 1994, Dahmer was beaten to death by a fellow inmate at the Columbia Correctional Institution in Portage, Wisconsin.

Dahmer's gruesome crimes have left a lasting impact on popular culture and have been the subject of numerous books, documentaries, and films, reflecting society's ongoing fascination with the dark aspects of human nature.
